The first character is either a hyphen or a 'd.' A hyphen denotes a regular file, while a 'd'
denotes a directory.
The next three characters tell us the permissions for the user that owns the file.
The following three characters tell us the permissions for all members of the group
which owns the file.
The final three characters tell us the permissions for all others. 

chmod 777 <filename>
sudo chown <username> <filename> - change file ownership 
sudo chgrp <groupname> <filename> - change file group ownsership
