What causes Queues?
Queue - Waiting in line
Variation 
    - arrival Variation
    - service Variation
Modeling Queues
    - Approaches
        - Analytic models [differential equations]
            - simple cases:
            - your faorite fast food spot 
        - Simultion [complex systems with simple stations]
            - Example: low observable [LO] aircraft
            maintenace systems [f22 & f 35]
Balance 2 Costs
    - Service Cost - cost of prividing service 
    - Waiting Cost - cost of not providing service 
        - Bulk: leave without buyung becuase the line is too long
        - buy and never return
    - Goal Minimize cost

Most Common Arrival Distribution
    - Poisson Distribution
        - Given an average arrival rate [lambda], the poisson distrion gives 
        the probability a certain number of customers [x] 
        arrive in a given time window
