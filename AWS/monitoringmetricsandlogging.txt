Monitoring Approach
- How much monitoring is right?
    - Is driven off by business needs
        - Availabily of Application
        - Security of Applications
    - Costs Money
    - Needs Someone to Read, interpret, and Act 
- Monitoring Approach 
    - Why and how to Monitor 
        - Which activities to monitor
        - Priority
            - Performance or security 
        - Which Activities and which tools (services)
    - How to select metrics for monitoring 
        - How and when (how often) to monitor 
    - How to use data 
        - selecting, aggregating, and visualizing data for monitor 

Outocome Based Monitoring
- Availability: Is it working?
- Performance: Is it fast? 
- Security/Compliance: Is it secured?
- Service Cost: Are cost predictable? 
- Accuracy: Are correct results returned?

Service Level Agreement
- Formalize Expectations
- What gets measured matters 
- Clarify "Fast" Performance 
    - fast interval of information?
    - fast user experience?

What to Monitor: Services 
- By an individual AWS services
- By a set of compnents (your code plus one or more AWS services)
- By entire application - utilization patterns
- By Blue/green Deployments (Past and current versions of an entire application) - Application life cyle 
    - Read MatrinFowler.com 

What to Monitor: metrics
- Evaluate key services
    - Your code an be a service 
- Review Suggested AWS service metrics
    - AWS exposes key metrice per service 
- Create Custom metrics as demand 
    - you can use AWS APIs and tools to create custom metrics 

Tools for Monitoring and Logging 
- AWS tools for patricular AWS Services
    - AWS Console
    - AWS CLI Tools 
    - AWS Cloudwatch or CloudTrail Logs
- AWS Application level tools
- Third Party Service or Application Tools 

Application Monitoring 
- Internet Layer (more in security than performace)
- User Interface Layer (Lambda, Code in EC2)
- Service Layers (S3, RDS, EC2)

Dashboards
- New Relic
- AWS X-Ray 
- Datadog 
- Stackdriver 
- Others 

Monitoring Core AWS Services
- Foundational AWS services
    - Amazon S3 and EC2 
- Commonly used AWS services
    - Compute - Elastic Beanstlak, EC2 Container Service, EC2 Container service, Lambda 
    - Database - Amazon Relational Database Serive (RDS) and redshift 
- Specialty AWS Serives
    - kinesis and Elastic MapReduce 

Setup for Monitoring AWS Services 
    - Create a test AWS Account
        - Can use free tier for a new account with some services
    - Create Nonroot user
    - Create an AWS billing alert
    - Turn services off when done testing 

Using Cloud Formation Stacks 
- A CloudFormation Template 
    - Is a JSON Template file
    - Is a run as an AWS Stack 
    - Use for:
        - Spin up service Instance
        - Include data(Files) in your instances

Monitoring S3 
- Create a Bucket in S3 using cloudformation (use a Template)
- Upload Files to Objects 
    - Stroage Class: Standard, Stadard IA, Reduced Redundancy
    - Encryption: none, Amazon S3 Master-key, AWS KMS master key 
- Properties 
    - Versioning
    - Logging
    - Static Website Hosting
    - Tags
        - key value pair 
            - monitor by tags

- Permissions 
- Management 
    - Lifecyle 
        - Lifecyle rule for Archiving to glacier 
    - Analytics
        - Automatically analyze storage usage and present it in chart to which data is not being accesed 
        - Sophiscated log reader to save money
    - Metrics 
        - Storage Metrics - Compliance - Logs the CRUD, and transfer of  of files inside s3 
        - Request Metrics 
        - Data Transfer Metrics
