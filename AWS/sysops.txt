1 Domain 1.0: Monitoring and Metrics
1.1 Demonstrate ability to monitor availability and performance
1.2 Demonstrate ability to monitor and manage billing and cost optimization processes

Service: CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network 
In AWS Monitor: EC2, ELB, ASG, RDS, SQS 

Cloudwatch and EC2 
- Basic Monitoring
    - 5 Minute intervals
    - Predeined Metrics
    - Status check of Metrics
- Detailed Monitoring
    - 1 Minute intervals
    - Same Metrics as basic monitoring 
    - Extra Costs
    - Available on a per instance basis 
- Additional Cloudwatch features
    - Custom Metrics
        - logged with Cloudwatch API 
        - Memory gathering script provided 
    - Logs
        - Text Matching Capabilities
    - Alarms 
        - Passive - sends notifications
        - Active - Performs actions
    - Dashboards
        - Graphs 
- Cloudewatch Alarm States Change 
    - Ok - under 70 CPU 
        - See Thershold in details
    - Alarm - Above 70 CPU            
    - Insuffiecient_data - EC2 is off 
-  Notifications
    - SNS Message 
    -  Auto Scaling Policy 
    - Frequency Dependent on notification type 

Cloudwatch Billing Alarm
    - Must Enable billing alerts
    - Data Stored in US-EAST-1 (N. Virginia) - Only available 
    - Accound-wide spend
    - Segmented by some AWS services

    - Steps
    - Preferences 
        - Receive Billing alerts 
        - Receive by email
        - Receive by Billing reports 
    - Create Alarm 
        - Enter total charges
        - SNS: enter your email 

SNS - Push mesaging services
- Topic Creation  
    - Create Topic Name 256 charactes
    - Display Name 10 charcacters 
- Topic Subscription 
    - Create Subrictions 
        - Protocol: Email, HTTP, Etc.
        - Endpoint: Emailaddress
        - Go to email and confirm substrciption 
- Topic Publication 
    - Publish a Message
        - Subject: your subject message 
        - Message: Your message 
        - Go back to emaila and see publication 
    - This will add to cloudwatch 

Create Alarm for Other services
- Shows when you have other services running 

Cloudwatch in Action 
- In EC2, see monitoring if Cloudwatch is Enable
    - Create a Alarm - https://www.lynda.com/Amazon-Web-Services-tutorials/Use-CloudWatch-alarm/569343/618786-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a8%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3aaws%0apage%3a2%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2

Extend Cloudwatch 
    - Physical -> Hypervisor (cloudwatch can monitor) -> Virtual Machine (AWS CLI - software agent - needs permission from cloudwatch -> reports to cloudwatch)

Monitor EC2 Memory 
    - Check if IAM role is assigned in EC2 
    - Create a IAM role 
        - See if if attach policy has right to use cloudwatch 
    - Use CLI, Boto, or Language SDK - to associate IAM role with cloudwatch 
    - SSH to the Instance - to install the software agent that will report to cloudwatch 
    - set a cron entry (for time)
