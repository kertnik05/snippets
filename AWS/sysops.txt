    - Application Layer
- Components
    - Environment
        - AWS has multiple regions separated georgraphically 
        - Availability Zone - Each region has multiple isolated location 
            - Each AZ is connected on low latency links
            - High Availability, fault tolerance, scale applications

Serverless Architecture
    - Challenge
        - better way to track securiity updates
        - serverless architechture would be ideal because we would not be adding any servers and only pay for compute time
    - Solutions 
        - AWS Lambda 
            - Python code executing on regular schedule 
                - will use SSH to query outstanding security updates on production instances

                - establishes an SSH to instances and execute scripts to check for outstanding security updates
            - lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers
            - AWS Lambda Edge - allows you to write functions deployed to the AWS network of edge locations in response to amazon cloudfront
        - Networking
            - Lambda runs in their own Amazon VPC
            - Amazon VPC Peering between two amazon VPCs to allow network connections between the AWS lambda function and the production EC2 (this require the creation of routing tables)
        - Security and Authentication 
            - Two Different Levels of Security
                - Via Boto SDK - When the function queries EC2 APIs 
                - SSH Conneciton - when the function estbalishes an SSH connection to the operating system
            - Configured with an IAM role and policy - wich grant access to query EC2 APIs
            - RSA authentication ( system operator will generate)
                - AWS lambda has the private key - so Lambda can SSH to EC2
                    - Private key is Encrypted using AWS Key management Service and stored in Amazon S3
                    - AWS lambda function  retrive the key from amazon s3 and decrypt with AWS KMS
                        - can now SSH to an EC2 instance in port 22
                        - IAM policies determine who can access the and decrypt the key 
                - The linux OS on production instance has the public key - see figure 1.1 
        - Lambda Supports

- implements compliance control 
- Records configuration changes
- Integrates with cloudtrail 
- Can record software changes with an agent 

    Config Rules - a feature of Config 
    - Describe desired state - example: Password Policy 
        - Billing Code tags example - checks the tag and not the value 
        - Change History: Cloudtrail, Configuration details, resource changes 
    - Periodic Check 
    - Event-driven check - Example: MFA is disabled 
    - AWS or Customer managed 
    - Dashboard 
    - Note: Config Rule check policy compliance - Changes occurs, periodic bais, and depends on configuration 
    - You dont select wheather a managed config rule executes on a schedule or on change basis 

    Config Basics
    - Simple Notification Service Notifications - is not required during setup 
    - S3 Bucket for configuration details

2 Domain 2.0: High Availability
2.1 Implement scalability and elasticity based on scenario
2.2 Ensure level of fault tolerance based on business needs
Fault Tolerance - The defining quality of a system that can continue to operate when a component failure occurs
High Availability - High availability is all about how long a given system stays up over a specified period of time. This is about the number of 9. 

Designing for Failure 
    - World 
        - Region 
            - Two or more AZ 
            - Edge Locations 
        - Tools HA 
            - Route 53 (DNS) - distribute traffic across regions 
                - Availability - Can perform health checks in Enpoints (Ip or URL)
                - Functional - String Matching first 5, 120 Bytes, No Pattern Matching, Global 
                - Can create Alarms and send to SNS 
                - Active/Passive Fail over 
                - 3 Options for Multi Region Design 
                    - Rout 53 Active Routing Options 
                        - Weighted Round Robin - AWS routes traffic based on the weight assigned to a record set, divided by the sum of all weights for all record sets
                            - In case of Failure, traffic will be pointed where most weight, and use ASG to increase the number of EC2 
                            - With a 5 3 route policy and two regions, what is the correct traffic distribution between regions? 3/8 and 5/8 
                        - Latency Based - DNS will compare latency 
                            - In failure, DNS will point route the traffic to a healthy region. ASG can be use to accomdate the traffic. 
                        - Geolocation based - GEO DNS 
            - ELB - distribute traffic inside one region  and accros AZ 
                - Can split inbound traffic to EC2 servers 
                - Route 53 to Check ELB health checks 
                - Internal/External ELB
                - SSL Decryption 
                - Simple Integration with AWS Certificate Manager 
                - Integrates with IAM for granular control 
                - Can do Health Checks on EC2 instances 
                - Sticky sessions - handled by load balancers generated cookies 
                - Classic Load Balancers 
                    - Supports layer 4 and layer 7 load balancing
                        - layer 4 (transport)
                            - TCP
                        - layer 7 (application) 
                            - X-forwared-for, -Proto, and -port 
                            - sticky session (cookie based)
                - Application Load Balancer 
                    - HTTP/2 - allows multiple request to be sent in a single connection
                    - Content-based routing - target group (EC2)
                        - Target Group - consist EC2, can include AZ and in one VPC 
                            - Create Target Group VPC 
                            - Add Instances to Group 
                        - Create ALB to associate target group with it 

                    - Improve Metrics - on ports 
                    - Support web sockets
                    - Support container  

            - Elastic IP - Can be re-assign from one instance to another 
                - Public static IP 
                    - if release, it will return to AWS pool and cannot get it back (similar to a regular public ip) 
                    - If an EC2 instance has a public IP address assigned by DHCP, that IP is release  while the instance is stopped
                - Can re-associate to another EC2 in case of failure 
                - EC2 must be in a subnet that is publicly accessible 
                - Hourly fee when not associated with a running EC2 instance
                - Scope limited to an individual AWS region 
                    - can move accos VPC within a region 
                - For Example, a legacy application server that cannot use Application Load balance. T
                    he Cloudwatch can post to sns and invoke a lambda function. Lambda can disaasociate the EIP from a failed instance to the working instance. 
            - ASG - to react to increase in request load - load triggers to increase the number of instance

Understanding Fault tolerant Components
    - Storage Options
        - S3 - Object Storage, accessible from anywhere 
            - Global namespace - must be unique 
            - 5TB maximum object size 
            - Web accesible 
            - Lifecyle Management 
            - Simple storage service availability 
                - availibility - standard 99.99%, reduced redundancy 99.99%, Infrequent Access 99.99%
                - durability - standard 100%, reduced redundancy 99.99%, Infrequent Access 100%,
                - Storage pricing - standard $$$, reduced redundancy $$, Infrequent Access $
                - Request Pricing - standard $, reduced redundancy $, Infrequent Access $$
            - CRR - S3 Cross region Replication
                - Turn on Versioning 
                - Turn on CRR 
                    - When there's a objects inside prior turn on CRR, has to be sync manually

        - EBS - Block storage, Hard drive to EC2 
            - Attached storage behavior 
            - can be encrypted 
            - 99.999% availability
            - attached to a single EC2 instance
            - Scope to a single AZ on a given region 
            - Snapshot capability 
                - stored in s3 
                - encrypted EBS, if Snapshot is create it also create an encrypted snapshot

            - Snapshots are transportable 
            - Lazy load to volumes 
            - How to minimize service disruptions 
                - Create a recurring snapshot 
                    - If EBS fails, grab the latest EBS snapshot 
                - When EBS volume fails, you will lose some data since the last snapshot was taken 
        - EFS - File storage, Mulitple EC2 can point to one EFS 
            - Fully Manage file service 
            - Network attach storage behavior

            - Create a mount target in each availability zone 
                - In case of failure, the app server can point to another EFS mount target 
                - You can move the app server to another AZ with the working EFS mount target 
            -  best way to configure a new instance to mount an EFS volume - dynamically identify the endpoint in the target AZ and mount it in user data 
    - Database Options
        - DynamoDB(NoSql)- high availability 
            - Fully managed by AWS 
            - Can be installed locally for development purposes
            - confined to a single aws region
            - Data replicated across three independent locations 
            - Designed to tolerate infastracture failure 
                - You can replicate multiple DyanmoDB tables to different regions using a multiple  Streams job.
            - Elastic Storage 
            - Elastic throughput
            - Continued Availability 
        - RDS

                    - Create automatic backups 

            - Use DNS name and not IP for database 
            - Read Replica Considerations
                - 5 for MySQL and PostgreSQL
                - 15 for Aurora 
                - Asynchronouse replication
                - Read only sql queries 
                - Need fresh data 
                - create read replica to another region 
            - RDS Limitations
                - Operationally dependent on AWS 
                - Inability to micropatch
                - Inability to use some database features
                - restricted privileges 
            - DB parameter group and or option group - to change database engine specific items

                    - configure primary node
                    - If primary node fails, it point to read replica with least amount replication lags and depends on DNS 
                    - Elastic cache - replaces the failed replica 
            - Memcahed Compatibility - read only 
                - Multi AZ 
                    - Create cache subnet group on each AZ

Amazon AMI 
    - are molds from which instance are huild
    - consist of basic installations of operating systems like server 2012 
    - may require you to have a lince for the OS
    - can be customize for future use 

EC2 Instance types 
    D - Density
    R - Ram

    M - General Purpose
    C - Compute

    G - Graphics
    I - IOPS
    F - FPGA
    T - Cheap General Purpose (Think T2 Micro)

    P - Graphics (think Pics)
    X - Extrem Memory

Regions 
- Choose the region to launch your resources 
- Think of latency 

availability zones 

EBS 
- can be customize size you need
- can be arranged in multiple mounted volumes
- lives independently of EC2; survives reboot 

EC2 
- connect with ssh keys provisioned by aws
- define network connectivity with security groups 
- tag instnces with metadata key-value pairs 

Elastic Load balancers (Classic Load Balancers) 
- High Avilability 
- fault tolerance
- integrated ssl support 
- cross zone load balancing
- basic http health checking
- integration with auto scaling groups 
- SSL   
    - can perform ssl termination
        - upload an ssl cert or use AWS certificate manager to get one for free 
        - Associate the cert with secure listener, such as https (Port 443)
        - use the same cert on multiple ELBs; update once without having to configure 
- Listeners 
    - listen on any port, forward to any port 
    - be internal (VPC private traffic only)
    - subject to security group 

Application load balancers 
- make layer 7 decisions
- route based on URL patterns
- load balance across multiple ports 

AWS Auto scalling 
- Vertical Scaling 
    - increase capicity of the host
    - can incure downtime 
- Horizontal scaling 
    - add host 
    - no downtime 
    - Steps 
        - Build and provision new machine 
        - Deploy your application
        - add new machines to load balancer 
        - Monitor appload to know when to take action 
- AWS auto scaling 
    - offers horizontal scaling as a service
    - spins up new ec2 instances on demand or in response to conditions 
    - charges only for the aws resources it creates for you 
    - Policy - ASG receives event from cloudwatch  
        - ASG can take action to add instance or remove instances 
            - launch configuration - when adding instance ASG reads from it
                - capture a series of choice for how to create instance 
                - can be associated with an ASG 
                - cannot be edite, only duplicated and re-associated 
                - Configuration Options
                    - AMI 
                        - Provisioning options 
                            - pre-bake an AMI 
                            - script configuration with user data 
                                - runs in root 
                    - Instance Type 
                    - Security groups

                    - scheduled scaling events 
            - Scaling policies
                - based on cloudwatch alarms 
                - Example: add new instnace when CPU usage exceeds 80% for 300 seconds
                - use cooldown times to define when instances should be removed 
    - Definition
        - Name
        - VPC and subnets
        - group size 
    
AWS Security Groups 
- resuable groups of network security rules
- define incoming and outing rules
- can be attached to almost any resource in AWS: 
    - EC2
    - ELB
    - RDS 
- Act like local firewalls for that resource 
    - Deny All incoming by default 
    - Allow all outgoing traffic by default 
    - Treat Deny as primary rule 
- Advantages
    - Reuse common rule sets
    - easily see where rule sets are applied
    - keep network access rules close to the resource they control 
    - apply multiple to a single resource 
    - Trusting other Security Groups 
        - Use SG-ID 

SSH Key Authentication 
- Port 22 
- SSHD running in server
    - user account exist 
    - AWS creates .pub and .pem with | chmod 300 my-key.pem 
        - AWS only keeps the .pub 
    - has public key: .pub
- Use SSH or putty in client
    - has .pem file 
- Using your private key 
    - ssh ec2-user@<remote_ip> -i /path/to/private_key.pem 
- SSH Keyring - list of private keys 
    - ssh-add /path/private_key.pem (add a private key)
    - ssh-add -d /path/private_key.pem  (remove a private key) 
    - ssh-add -l 
    - ssh-add-D - removes all the keys (it doesn't delete)

Securing your AWS Account with IAM
- IAM - provides a centralize management of access and authentication of users to the services in an AWS account
- No charge - its free
- User, Group, and Role have policy (JSON) applied to them 
    - Policy
        - define what and how resource can be accessed 
        - uses least previlage 
- IAM allows appropriate credentials to be defined for users
- IAM is integrated in AWS marketplace - control over usage and software cost
- IAM User 
    - is an entity to interact with the resources 
    - can be any individual, system, or application (console, SDK, CLI)
    - unique name and unique credentials
    - when AWS account is first created - it creates a root user account ID 
        - root user are unrestricted 
        - best practice:
            - Do not use root user, when interacting with resources create a separate IAM user with admin previlege 
- IAM credential 
    - 3 ways to use AWS services and resources 
        - AWS Management Console
            - Do not use root user
            - uses username and password
        - SDK
            - uses access key ID and secret access key
        - CLI
            - uses access key ID and secret access key
