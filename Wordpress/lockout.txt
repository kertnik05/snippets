To see all of the records associated with the limit login plugin, run the following:

SELECT * FROM wp_options WHERE option_name LIKE '%limit%' 

Change wp_options to the correct table name for your install. 


To clear the lockouts, run the following:

UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = '' WHERE option_name = 'limit_login_lockouts'

Again, change wp_options to the correct table name for your install.
