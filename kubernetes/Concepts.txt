Pods - Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. A pod consists of one or more Docker containers that
together perform a single task.

Cluster Concepts
Control Plane 
    - Actions
        - Cluster Management
        - Scheduler
    - Master Node
        - responsible for maintaining the desired state for your cluster
        - using the kubectl command-line interface, you're communicating with your cluster's Kubernetes master
        - refers to a collection of processes managing the cluster state
        - master can also be replicated for availability and redundancy
        - Components
            - API Server - Rest operation and front end where user interact
            - Controller Management - Application Controller, endpoint Controller and namespace Controller
            - Scheduler - Policy and Topology aware and schedule containers 
            - Etcd
                - etcd is a consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
            - Cloud Controller 
            - Addons - extends functionality of Kubernetes like DNS
        - $ kubectl create -f pod.yaml
    - Worker
        - Kubelet - primary node communicates with master api server, creates Pods, reports status of each pods to api server
        - Kube-proxy - communicates with master api server and network proxy on each node, filtering and traffic redirection using ip tables
    
CNI network - Common network for weavenet, calico, etc.
Data Plane
    - Run containers and applications
    - Rare user interaction
