certainly, here you go:

1) Please go to "My Downloads" on xtento.com and download the three modules for order export/tracking import/stock import.
2) Install the modules as explained here: http://support.xtento.com/wiki/Installing_and_setting_up_a_Magento_extension
3) Go to System > XTENTO and enter the license keys and enable the three modules
4) Please make sure the Magento cronjob has been set up: http://support.xtento.com/wiki/Setting_up_the_Magento_cronjob

Order Export:
1) Copy the file app/code/local/Xtento/OrderExport/Model/Destination/Http.php from a live store (NRSC for example) into the app/code/local/Xtento/OrderExport/Model/Destination/ folder on the new site.
2) Open the Http.php file on the new site using an editor and if required, adjust the "Authorization" key for the API
3) Go to Sales > Sales Export > Tools in the Magento admin of a live store (NRSC for example) and export the "profile" and "destination" there. Then, go to Sales > Sales Export > Tools on the new site and import the downloaded JSON file there to upload the configuration.
4) On the new site, go to Sales > Sales Export > Export Profiles, open the only existing export profile ("Edit Profile"), and open the "Output Format" tab. Please make sure to adjust the order# prefix there:
<xsl:value-of select="concat($sepstart, 'xref', $sepmid, php:functionString('json_encode', concat('NR', increment_id)), $sepend)"/>
In this case the prefix is NR. Replace it with whatever you want. Then, click on "Save Profile".

Stock Import: 
1) Copy the file app/code/local/Xtento/StockImport/Model/Source/Http.php from a live store (NRSC for example) into the app/code/local/Xtento/StockImport/Model/Source/ folder on the new site.
2) Open the Http.php file using an editor and if required adjust, the "Authorization" key for the API
3) Go to Catalog > Stock Import > Tools in the Magento admin of a live store (NRSC for example) and export the "profile" and "source" there. Then, go to Catalog > Stock Import > Tools on the new site and import the downloaded JSON file there to upload the configuration.

Tracking Import:
1) Copy the file app/code/local/Xtento/OrderStatusImport/Model/Connection/Custom.php from a live store (NRSC for example) into the app/code/local/Xtento/OrderStatusImport/Model/Connection/ folder on the new site
2) Open the Custom.php file using an editor and if required adjust, the "Authorization" key for the API. Also, please adjust the order# prefix (set up in order export step 4) in this file:

$prefix = 'NR';

3) Go to System > XTENTO > Tracking Number Import in a live store (NRSC for example) to see the configuration and apply exactly the same configuration at System > XTENTO > Tracking Number Import on the new site.
