controllers: controllers folders are formed by actions that process web
server requests

Magento comes with the following routers:
• Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Router_Admin
• Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Router_Standard
• Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Router_Default

The action controller will then load and render the layout, which in turn will load the
corresponding blocks, models, and templates.

Example:
http://localhost/catalog/category/view/id/10
URIs are comprised of three parts – /FrontName/ControllerName/ActionName
• FrontName: catalog
• ControllerName: category
• ActionName: view


In Magento, MVC controllers are designed to be thin controllers; thin controllers
have little business logic and are mostly used for driving the application requests.
A basic Magento controller action would just load and render the layout:
	public function viewAction()
		{
			$this->loadLayout();
			$this->renderLayout();
		}
From here it is the job of the blocks to handle the display logic, get the data from our
models, prepare the data, and send it to the views.
