API Value Chain - The most important link so people will use your api are the Developers

Best Practices:
    https://api.website.com/v1/resourcename 
1. avoid using www.websitename.com
2. Keep your base url simple
3. Use subdomain or a Separate subdomain

Resource Name 
1. Should be noun and plural - https://api.website.com/v1/items/{id}
2. Verbs is ok. (API Operation != Crud)
    - https://api.website.com/v1/estimates/price/{}
    - https://api.website.com/v1/search?query
3. Actions
    Post /vacation/{id}/book
    Post /book/vacation
    Get  /vacations/search?
4. Associations - try to avoid deep nesting, use the query if not avoiadable
    facebook /me/phptos
    walmart  items/{id}/reviews
    twitter musts/users/list
    get - /vacation/{id}/reviews
    Get pud delete - /vacation/{id}/reviews/{review-id}


Rest API CRUD 
    - Mapping CRUD to HTTP Methods
        - Post = Create
        - Get = Read or Retrive
        - Put, Patch = Update
        - Delete = Delete
    - Use of HTTP status code 3 digit
        - 1** = informational = continue
        - 2** = success = (200 = ok, 201 = created)
        - 3** = redirect = Temporary redirect
        - 4** = client error = (400 = Bad Request, 404 = Not Found, 401 = Unauthorized, 403 = Forbidden, 415 = Unsupported Media)
        - 5** = server error = (500 = Server Error)
        - Limit your api to 8 status code
        - Error Response Content-Type - Common is json
            - Content-Type:"Application/json"
        - Application Specific Errors
            - 7002 = Error code - Required field missing
        - Use a standard Error Template for the response
            - {
                text: 'Custom Message',
                timestamp: new Date(),
                method: 'Post', //Post, Get, Put, Patch, Delete
                endpoint: 'http://api.acme.com/v1/vacations',
                errors:  {
                    code: Application-Specific-Error-Code,
                    text: "Message Describing the Error",
                    hints: ["Hints to the developer on the potential issues"],
                    info: "link to more information"
                },
                payload: receivedPayload (Debug Use only)
            }
            - Alternate Approach (from Facebook)
                - Always sends back HTTP status = 200 ok
                - Response 
                    {
                        status: {..},
                        payload: {..}
                    }
    - Support Multiple resource formats

Uniform Interface Constraint
    - contract for communicationm between client and server
    - HTTP Methods
    - HTTP status codes
    - Representation formats

Post Request Handling 
    - Post = Create = /vacations or /vacations/{id}/reviews
        - when sucess, return code=201 
            - May return a link to a new resource in location header
                - http://api.example.com/vacations/121/reviews/2
            - May return the new object
    - Failure 404 - Bad Request - 400 missing required field
    - Failure 500 - server error
    - Get = Read or Retrive /vacations or /vacations/{id}
        -  when sucess, return code 200 ok 
            - server sends back in requested formats
            - http://api.acme.com/vacations/121
        - Failure 4** Bad request - ex resource not Found
        - Failure 5** Server Error - ex 500 internal server error
    - Put, Patch = Update - (Put Use when updating all the attributes, Patch when updating specific attribute)
        - PUt can create if client provide an ID. (Not suggested)
        - Patch http://api.acme.com/vacations/121/?fieldname=value 
        - success: return 200, 204 (no content), and 201 (created)
            - resource in body of response - Optional
            - No need to send the link - optional
    - Delete = Delete
        - URL: /vacation  - deletes all vacation
            - /vacation/{id} - deletes specific vacation
        - Success: 200, or 204(No returned content) - May return deleted resource in the response body
        - Failure 4** -  Bad Request - ex 404 resouce not Found
        - Failure 5** - Issue in processing - ex 503 database unreachable

Resource Representation (Support: json, xml, csv)
    - Query Parameters
        - search?key=value&format=xml, search?key=value&format=json, search?key=value&format=csv
    - HTTP header Accepts - Accepts: application/json, Accepts: application/xml
    - Resource Format Suffix - /programmes/schedules/fm/today.json, /programmes/schedules/fm/today.xml
    - Whats Common:
        - HTTP Accept header is not so Common
        - Most Providers set the default fomat = json 
    - Respose:
        - Must include a Content-Type in the header
        - Return HTTP status code
        - Documentation:
            - list supported formats
            - How requestor specifies

API Changes
    - Non Breaking Changes
        - adding a resource 
            - Get /hotels
        - adding optional Parameters or properties
            - Get /vacations?limit=3
    - Breaking Change
        - Change the HTTP verb or Methods
            - Put /vacations to Post /vacations
        - Delete an Operation
            - Get /vacationsByDestination
    - Backend Change
        - Minor Change - change attribute length
        - Major Change - Discount calculator requires more Parameters
    - Avoid Changes
        - Is the change realy adding value?
        - Eliminate or minimize impact on app Developers
        - Provide planning opportunity to the add Developers
        - Support Backward compatibility (if possible)
        - Provice support to app Developers with the Changes
        - Minimize change frequency e.g., once per 6 months

Rest API Versioning
    - Creation and Management of multiple releases of a software
        - Not the same as verison control
    - How to specify version?
        - Uses the date of release 
            - version="10/1/2015" - twillo
        - Major.Minor
            - version="12.61" or version="v12.61" - Facebook
        - Single Digie i.e, No Minor Version 
            - version="12" or version="v12" - Uber
    - What will be the format for information?
        - HTTP Header - "x-myapi-version:1.2"
        - Query Parameter - /post?version=1.2 facebook 
        - URL - /v1/charges - uber 
        - Hybrid 
            - https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges -  Major change
            - HTTP Header - "2016-07-06"  - Minor change

API Change Strategy
                    Q1/2017     Q2/2017     Q2/2017     Q2/2017 
    - Version-1    Avaialable   Deprecate   Retire
    - Version-2                 Avaialable  Deprecate
    - Version-3                             Avaialable   

    - Support at least 1 previous version for a period of time
        - E.g, 3 months
    - Markt the previous version a deprecated
        - For new apps developers can access only the latest version
    - Publish a roll out plan in advance
    - Mange changelog that clearly shows the reason for new version

- Example Code: 
    - Git https://github.com/acloudfan/REST-API-Course
    - npm install
    - Enter your credentials from mlab
        - https://github.com/acloudfan/REST-API-Course/blob/master/tests/TestDbOps.js
    - $ node tests/TestDbOps.js
    - $ node index
    - http://localhost:3000/v1/vacations (postman)
    

Rest API Caching
    - Benefits of Caching 
        - improves performaance
        - Higher scalability/throughput
            - how many calls per second
                - to increase calls, midtier cahcing 
    - Design decision
    - who caches?
        - client, ISP, Gateway, midtier caching (API), dbcaching 
    - What to cahce
        - Speed of change
            - If speed of change is fast, 
        - Time sensivity
            - Do not cahce Time sensity - Vacation package experition
        - Security 
            - customer profile should not be cache in the intermdiaries
    Design Decisions
        - Which Compotnents should control caching? Should be the API
        - What to cache? who can cache? (Http Cache control directives)
        - For how long is the cahced data valid? (Http Cache control directives)
    - Cache Control directives - https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9
        -  To control the cache control directives
            - The Cache-Control general-header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request/response chain.
        - Cache control: "directive-1, directive-2"
        - Cache control: "private, max-age=60"
        - Server API Response HTTP Header: ( who can cache the response?, For how long?, Under what conditions? )
            - "Cache-Control" ":" 1#cache-directive
        - Client Request HTTP Header:
            - Ovveride the caching behavior
        - Private vs Public
            - Sensitive data should not be cached on intermediaries
                - Private data is meant for a single user 
                - Cache-Control: "private, max-age=60"
                - default is public
        - No-Store
            - Sensitive data should not be stored anywhere (bank data, medical records"
            - Cache-Control: "no-store, max-age=60"
        - No-Cache Etag
            - Always get the data from the server
            - Subsequent request to the same URL will return different data
            - Etag header can be used to chec if the data has changed
            -Etag 
                - server sends an Etag from the server
                - client gets the original Etag
                - client  sends Etag, server check if etag change 
                - if etag change, server will send response http header of 200 and status ok,. Else, server http response cdoe: 304, Message: Not modified
                    - Cache-Control: "no-store, max-age=60" 
                      Etag: "xxxxx"
                    - Use for stocks
            - Social Security - use No-Store and No-Cache
        - Max-age 
            - Lifetime of the cahce data or its validity
            - Cache-Control: "max-age=60"
            - Cache-Control: "private, max-age=60"
                - Cache valid for 60 sec and intermediaries instructed not to cache
            - Cache-Control: "no-cache"
                - requestor can validate by sending the Etag
    - Example Code: http://localhost:3000/ (URL)
            - Git https://github.com/acloudfan/REST-API-Caching
            - npm install
            - $ node index
            - http://localhost:3000/ (url)

Partial Response
    - Api Consumer in control of response
    - Why send a Partial Response? For mobile
    - Benifits 
        - Performance and optimize resource usage
            - CPU, Memory, and bandwidth
        - Api consumer contrrols the granularity
        - Common API version for all consumers
            - To support multiple devices, use cases - form factors
    - Specification
        - /people:(id, first-name, last-name) - Linkedin
        - /friends?fields=id,name,picture - Facebook 
        - /pins?fields=id,link,creator(firstname) - pinterest
    - Example Code: 
            - Git https://github.com/acloudfan/REST-API-Course/branches
            - npm install
            - Enter your credentials from mlab
                - https://github.com/acloudfan/REST-API-Course/blob/partialresponse/tests/TestHotelsDbOps.js
                - https://github.com/acloudfan/REST-API-Course/blob/partialresponse/index.js
            - $ node tests/TestDbOps insert 
            - $ node index
            - http://localhost:3000/v1/hotels?fields=name,city (Postman)
Pagination
    - API consumer in control of response
        - Asks for "Number of Rows" needed
    - Pagination controls how many rows the app developer is requesting
    - Benifits 
        - Performance and optimize resource usage
            - CPU, Memory, and bandwidth
    - Design Options
        - Cursor based - Facebook - https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api/#paging
            - Cursor -  control structure that enables traversal of records 
            - considered most efficient 
            - Cursor: "random string"
            {
                "data": [
                    ... Endpoint data is here
                ],
                "paging": {
                    "cursors": {
                    "after": "MTAxNTExOTQ1MjAwNzI5NDE=", //Begining of the response 
                    "before": "NDMyNzQyODI3OTQw" //End of the response 
                    },
                    "previous": "https://graph.facebook.com/me/albums?limit=25&before=NDMyNzQyODI3OTQw" //Points to the previous page
                    "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/me/albums?limit=25&after=MTAxNTExOTQ1MjAwNzI5NDE=" //Points to the next page
                }
            }
        - Offset based - Linkedin (most popular approach)
            - This uses the query parameter 
                - Get /hotels?Offset=6&limit=5 
            - /people?start=50&count=25 - Linkedin
            - /friends?offset=50&limit=25 - Facebook 
            - /search?page=3&rpp=25 - twitter 
        - Use of HTTP header - Github
            - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988
            - To create relationship between resources
                - /search/code?q=addclass - Github 
                    - response a data and http header
                    - header 
                        - Link: <https://api.github.com/user/repos?page=3&pager_page=100>; rel="next",  //Links to the Next page 
                                <https://api.github.com/user/repos?page=50&pager_page=100>; rel="last" //links to the last page
        - Example Code: 
            - Git https://github.com/acloudfan/REST-API-Course/branches
            - npm install
            - Enter your credentials from mlab

Security
    - Application -> Gateway -> API -> database
    - API - Provides an attack surface to hackers
        - Data Theft
        - Data Manipulation
        - Identity Theft
        - DOS attack
    - Who is the caller of API?
        - Authentication 
            - Basic Authentication - consumer sends the AUthorization in HTTP hedader
                - AUthorization: Encoded-Creds 
                    - Based64 Encoded
                    - User: Password
                - Weakness
                    - Man in the middle attack 
                    - Caller must always send the credentials in every request 
                    - Rest api doesn't support session
                - Must be use with TLS/HTTPs 
    - Is Transaction Authorized?
    - Security of Data 
        - Protect the data from theft and integrity of data
        - Data at rest is outside the scope of Rest API
        - Data in motion is inside the scope of Rest API 
        - Always use TLS/HTTPs for Rest API 
            - Do not use self signed certificates
    - Authentication middleware for Node.js http://passportjs.org/ 
        - Non intrusive - keeps the code maintainable
        - Supports multiple forms of Authentication
        - Built in Support for social Authentication 
        - Over 300 strategy 
    - Example Code: 
            - Git https://github.com/acloudfan/REST-API-Course-Security
            - npm install
            - $ node app
            - http://localhost:3000/private (url and postman)
                - enter username and password from here https://github.com/acloudfan/REST-API-Course-Security/blob/master/userdata/users.js
                - Postman 
                    - Basic Auth 
                    - Enter username and password
                - In Postman, Header request header 
                    - Basic c2FtOnNhbTEyMw== - if  c2FtOnNhbTEyMw== is decoded  = sam:sam123 
Token Based API Security
    - Understanding of Tokens
        - Token is an Encoded string 
            - hashing or private key for encryption
        - Eliminates the need for session on API
            - http header
            - query Parameters
            - request body
        - Issuer can control the validity
            - expiry
            - revocation 
        - Dreams invoke /token{credentials} -> Acme validates credetials and issue credentials to dreams and Acme save the token in its database
            - Dreams can now request a resource: /resource{token} 
            - Acme validates the token and check the storage for its token 
            - If token is expired, it will issue 401
    - JSON Web Tokens  (JWT) - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519
        - eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.   //Header based 64 Encoded
            eyJpc3MiOiJ0b3B0YWwuY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNDI2NDIwO. //Payload(Registered/public/private claims) based 64 Encoded
            yRQYnWzskCZUxPwaQupWkiUzKELZ49eM7oWxAQK_ZXw //Signature - combination of hashing of header and payload  along with the secret
                - secret needs to be confidential 
        - Self contained
        - json based
        - Header 
            - Type
                - "JWT"
            - Hashing Algorithm
                - "HS256"
                - "HMAC"
            - Example
                {
                    “alg”: “HS256”,
                    “typ”: “JWT”
                }
        - Payload (Claims) https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml
            - Registered Claims 
                - iss (Issuer e.g. "acloudfan.com)
                - exp Expirty timestamp
                - nbf Not before timestamp 
                - If the change controller is IESG in https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml, it means its a registered claims. Else, its a public claims
            - Public Claim 
                - name
                - Email
                - Phone numer 
                - There's a registry for public claims
            - Private Claim 
                - consumer and provider decide what to use 
                - risk: private claim can collide with public claims
        - Node Module
            - jwt-simple 
                - consumer invokes /token body:{credentials}  (Express)
                - credentials is then hashed by jwtauth.js and then stored to the tokenstorage.js in database at the same time issue a token to the consumer 
                - consumer invokes /private header:{token}
                - validator.js in server will validate the token
        - Code Example: 
            - jwtauth.js creates the token and app.js issues the token to the requestor 
        - Example Code: 
            - Git https://github.com/acloudfan/REST-API-Course-Security/branches
            - npm install
            - $ node app
            - http://localhost:3000/token (Postman) -  post json request 
            - Consumer do a Post request in Postman body: select raw application json 
                - {"name":"sam", "password":"sam123"}
                - Press send - you get a token in json format 
                    - {
                        "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1MDU2ODQzMDUwMDIsImlzcyI6IkFDTUUgVHJhdmVscyIsIm5hbWUiOiJzYW0iLCJlbWFpbCI6InNhbUBtYWlsLmNvbSJ9.-troSrlhiYrhir4SLruAJA3uGac3_QvBiuzqPmmEFEg"
                    }
                    - Base 64 Decoded format of the token
                    - {"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"} - header 
                        {"exp":1505684305002,"iss":"ACME Travels","name":"sam","email":"sam@mail.com"} - payload
                        Xbbb	{iмΣAD - signature 
            - Consumer does another request and this time the get request 
                - http://localhost:3000/private Get method 
                    - In the header, add a key value 
                        - key: x-acme-token 
                        - valeu: yourgeneratedtokenfrompostrequest
                    - Hit send
                    - validator.js - reads and validates the token send by the requestor 
API Key and Secret 
    - What is API key and secret?
        - If you use facebook or twitter, register your application to the provider 
            - in return, the provider will issue use and password for app almost like a username and password 
            - API key identifies an API consumer 
                - Client Key,
                - Client ID 
            - API Secret used by the client to prove its Identity
                - password
                - digital signature 
        - Steps
            - Consumer register to the Provider
            - Provider Issues an API key and Digital Signature
            - consumer sends A get request with  API key + Digital signature to the Provider 
            - Provider validates the API Key and Digital Signature 
        - Amazon allows anonymous access to s3
            - Developer creates a signature
            import base64
            import hmac 
            import sha 
            h = hmac.new("randomstringofsignature", HTTTP-HEADER)
            base64.encodedstring(h.digest()).strip()
        - How Keys Used?
            - API Key in combination with Secret used for Authentication
            - Usage Analytics 
            - Gettting Tokens from API provider 
            - Rate limiting 
                - External Application is limited to request of 180 calls/15 minutes like Twitter 
        - Design Decisions
            - Sending the API key and Secret/signature
                - HTTP header
                - Query Parameter
                - Request Body

Oauth 2.0 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749
    - Flexible Authorization framework 
    - Uses different types of tokens 
    - Describes 5 methods (grants) for acquiring access tokens
    - End user in control of their data (Scope)
    - Application/client needs a API key and Secret 
    - Authorization scope grant 
        - Social login Scheme
            - Application or client (consumer)
                - 1. Application ask permission from the user for authorization 
                - 3. Application sends the Authorization grant to the provider 
                - 6. Application recieves the Access Token from the provider and it can continously use this token 
                    - 7 If Access Token is Expired, Consumer can request Refresh Token from the Provider 
            - User (Owner of Data)
                - 2. User gives the Authorization grant - generates the Authorization Token 
            - Provider 
                - Authorization server
                    - 4. Autorization server reads the Authorization grants 
                    - 5. Authorization server issues an Access Token to the consumer  
                    - Provideer may define multiple types of Access Token, Expiry set by the Provider  
                        - Facebook: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/
                    - 8. Refresh Token issued to the consumer  
                - Resource or API server

        - Owasp provides a good notes for protecting a rest api
    - Exploits functional Attacks
        - Attack through app
        - Attack API directly
        - Cross site forgery 
    - Common Functional Attack 
        - SQL Injection - data driven application
            - A form that has an API behind the scene
                - the user can inject sql in one of the fields 
        - Fuzzing - Random input to understand vulnerabilities 
        - Cross Site Forgery - Attack script on user's browser
        - Session/Token Hijacking - Theft of access token from the user's browser
