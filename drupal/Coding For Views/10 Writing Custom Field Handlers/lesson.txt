Step 1:
Find which handler to extend from
In this case field numeric handler

Step 2:
Create a file definition for the handler: databasics_handler_field_percent.inc
Add the file inside the .info

Step 3: Create a class inside: databasics_handler_field_percent.inc

Tips: Turn on the Views SQL to view sql output

Step 4: Go to Drupal API and search the handler name to see the class and their heirarchy

IF it's the parent class you are extending from - look at the child class as to how it got extended
