Plugin: An individual unit of functionality
Plugin Types: Definition of what functionality provided (block for example)
Plugin Manager: Central controlling class
    - Discovery and discovery decorators
    - Factories for instatiation
    - Derivatives
Plugin Consumer: Custom code that leverages the functionality provided by plugins

Common plugin types
    Block: Add a new block that an administrator can place via the block layout UI
    Field formatter: Add a new option for display data contained in fields of a specific type(s)
    Field widget: Add a new form widget for collecting data for fields of a specific type(s)

To get list of plugins:
drupal  debug:plugin //Display Plugin type and Plugin manager class

To see all plugin managers: https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/services
- search for any prefixed with plugin.manager

To get a list of the plugin types that Drupal console can generate for you
drupal list generate:plugin

All plugin managers are implementations of the \Drupal\Component\Plugin\PluginManagerInterface, 
    which extends the \Drupal\Component\Plugin\Discovery\DiscoveryInterface, 
    \Drupal\Component\Plugin\Factory\FactoryInterface and, 
    \Drupal\Component\Plugin\Mapper\MapperInterface

Types of Discovery
Annotated Class Discovery 
    - \Drupal\Core\Plugin\Discovery\AnnotatedClassDiscovery
    - MyPluginManager::discovery = new AnnotatedClassDiscovery('Plugin/Block', $namespaces, 'Drupal\block\Annotation\Block');
YAML discovery 
    - \Drupal\Core\Plugin\Discovery\YamlDiscovery
    - MyPluginManager::discovery = new YamlDiscovery('sandwich', $module_handler->getModuleDirectories());
Info hook discovery
    - \Drupal\Core\Plugin\Discovery\HookDiscovery
    - MyPluginManager::discovery = new HookDiscovery($this->moduleHandler, 'block_info');
Static Discovery
    - \Drupal\Component\Plugin\Discovery\StaticDiscovery
    - MyPluginManager::discovery = new StaticDiscovery();

Plugin-factories-and-mappers

Factories provide the plugin manager with a MyPluginManager::createInstance() method which proxies the request to the selected factory class, 
which, in turn, can instantiate and return the specified plugin instance.
\Drupal\Component\Plugin\Factory\FactoryInterface

The default factory
Example return from DefaultFactory::createInstance() for the plugin class HamSandwich:
// Arguments passed to __construct() method:
// - $configuration (array): Passed to the createInstance() method from caller.
// - $plugin_id (string): Unique ID of the plugin being instantiated.
// - $plugin_definition (array): Plugin meta-data read from the annotation.
return new HamSandwich($configuration, $plugin_id, $plugin_definition);

The container factory
The Drupal\Core\Plugin\Factory\ContainerFactory class extends the Drupal\Component\Plugin\Factory\DefaultFactory class 
and as such does the same things with one major addition: it injects a copy of the Drupal services container by calling the plugin's ::create()

The reflection factory
Drupal\Component\Plugin\Factory\ReflectionFactory 

Mappers
Mappers are used when the plugin manager needs to locate a plugin instance based on application context instead of via a unique ID. 
Mappers provide the plugin manager with a ::getInstance() method that can return the correct plugin based on additional logic.
Checkout the example from \Drupal\Core\Field\FormatterPluginManager::getInstance() to get an idea of how this might work.
