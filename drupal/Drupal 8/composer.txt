php composer.phar - to see list of composer commands
php composer.phar init - init command will ask you several questions about your project
    When ask, Would you like to define your dependencies (require) interactively [yes]? - yes 
        go to - https://packagist.org/ and search for package you want to install 
            - most packages have documentation here https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html
        In this example, look for finder in https://packagist.org
        - This will generate composer.json
            - {
                "name": "family/drupal-8.5.0",
                "type": "project",
                "require": {
                    "symfony/finder": "v4.0.8"
                },
                "authors": [
                    {
                        "name": "John Paul Mariano",
                        "email": "jppm8387@yahoo.com"
                    }
                ]
            }

php composer.phar install - this will install your dependencies inside the vendor folder

To use the finder: 
    Read the docs
    https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/finder.html

    - to install globally in drupal. 
    - add the require __DIR__.'/../../../../vendor/autoload.php';

To add another vendor package: edit the composer.json
    {
        "name": "family/drupal-8.5.0",
        "type": "project",
        "require": {
            "symfony/finder": "v4.0.8"
            "symfony/filesystem": "v4.0.8"
        },
        "authors": [
            {
                "name": "John Paul Mariano",
                "email": "jppm8387@yahoo.com"
            }
        ]
    }
    - run: php composer.phar update  - this will read the package.json 
    - another way to add a package: php composer.phar require 
        - then search for package to install
To update a single vendor package -  run: php composer.phar update symfony/filesystem
