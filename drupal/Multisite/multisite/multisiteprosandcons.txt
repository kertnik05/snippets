Is multisite the right choice for my next site?

Are the websites related enough? 

Drupal core files and contributed modules are shared:
Pros: One place to upload core and contrib
Cons: you'll have to make all of your shared websites unavailable during upgrades

complexity
traffic patterns
commonalities between the two websites
experience and ability to work through a few common issues

--------------------------

Are they lightweight, and is the traffic low enough to not strain the server?

You're sharing not only your codebase, but the websites are also sharing memory, PHP processes, and database use (if shared). 
For each website added, fewer resources are available to all of the websites.

If your websites are sharing a database and website A causes the database to crash, website B will go down, since all the resources are shared. 
This is also true for memory and other server resources.

Would a combined development workflow help or hurt me?
Lots of development on website B means that the version control repository grows, 
which increases the size of checkouts for website A, because it means checking out code for both websites.

Is this new website big, complex, and important enough to deserve its own isolated environment?
A bigger or heavily trafficked website may be better in an isolated environment to prevent either slowdowns or upgrades to other websites from risking the larger site's integrity
