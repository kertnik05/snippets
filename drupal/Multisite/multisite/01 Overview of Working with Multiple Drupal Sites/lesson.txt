Multisite
What's the problem?
- Multiple sites that have the same structure and features
- Wanting to keep editorial access and control locked down per area
- Multiple sites where you need to share content and/or users, but also have different themes and content

Question to Ask?
- Will you be sharing any content between sites?
- Will you need to control user access differently on sites?
- Do they need to share domain name and/or infastracture?

Points to Consider
- Content storage/sharing and canonical location
- Users, profiles, and permission management
- Feature and and style standarization
- Site Administration and code/server management
- performance
