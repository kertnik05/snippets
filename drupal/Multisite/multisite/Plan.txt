Current Configuration:

Defaults:
sites/default
sites/howard.prod (Symlink of sites/default) -  www2.howard.edu points to this folder
sites/default/files
sites/default/settings.php

sites/all/themes/howard - Too Customize (not a good idea to have the main theme being used)

sites/all/libraries - can be shared accross sites
sites/all/modules - can be shared accross sites
sites/all/themes  - can be shared accross sites

Steps To take:

 Duplicate the Database: 
 Work with andrew for cleanup Themes and Database
 - Test LDAP (Our Authentication is not done through Drupal, it is Process by LDAP)
 - Remove Users and Contents (I tested this locally and was able to bypass user 1. I reset johnpaul.mariano using user 1, but the LDAP is showing you are not authenticated)
 - Reauthenticate - All users need to be re authenticated through LDAP.
 - Maintain Theming Layer 
 
 In normal multisite installations, the main default site (sites/default/) is just barebones and not being used. 
 A sites/all/themes should have the main theme howard. The rest of the multisite should just create a subtheme. 
 According to the book that Andrew shared, if you try to override the same theme in the sub sites ( like sites/<subdomain>.howard.prod/themes), we have to be careful.
 It mentioned that we shouldn't really so much on the Drupal's fallback mechanism. 

 - Have Andrew Figure out Zen theme as the base theme of howard or have the howard as the base theme
 
 Create Folders (Check #acquia about symlinks)
 sites/<subdomain>.howard.prod/libraries - site specifics libraries (note: can have a libraries specific to the site as long as it is not in sites/all)
 sites/<subdomain>.howard.prod/modules - site specifics modules (note: can have a module specific to the site as long as it is not in sites/all)
 sites/<subdomain>.howard.prod/themes - site specifics themes (note: can have a themes specific to the site as long as it is not in sites/all)
 
  sites/<site_name>/settings.php - http://cooks.local/install.php (NORMAL PROCESS) check #acquia
  $databases['default']['default'] = array(
     'driver' => 'pgsql',
     'database' => 'databasename',
     'username' => 'username',
     'password' => 'password',
     'host' => 'localhost',
    'prefix' => '',
     );
     
   
 sites.php - check #acquia
 $sites['www2.howard.edu'] = 'default';
 $sites['<subdomain.howard.eduy'] = 'foldername';
 
 
    
 Sharing Variables
 
 if (file_exists('sites/all/shared-settings.php')) {
     include 'sites/all/shared-settings.php';
 }
 shared-settings.php 
 <?php /**
      * @file
      * Shared settings for all multi-sites.
      */
     global $conf;
     $conf['site_slogan'] = "Quality Information";
