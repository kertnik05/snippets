Features plumber - Features will auto-detect dependencies for you, which can be very handy, 
				but at times it can also be very frustrating when you don't want them to. 
				It provides a checkbox to other autodetected components to include/exclude

We are sometimes asked how Features can be removed. Since a Feature is just 
a normal module, you can disable it on your module administration page, and 
even uninstall and completely remove it from your modules folder. That will 
completely remove the feature from your site.
