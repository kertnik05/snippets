    So you want to become a PHP developer. And not just any ol' programmer, 
    but someone who writes great code and can work on exciting projects. Well 
    then, this screencast series is for you!
    
    We'll learn how to develop with PHP from the very beginning, with a real

    practice immediately.

    In this episode, we learn about:

    * creating your first PHP file
    * using functions
    * variables
    * loops and if statements
