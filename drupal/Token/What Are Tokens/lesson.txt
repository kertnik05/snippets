-Global vs Contextual Tokens

What are Tokens?
Tokens are specially formatted chunks of text that serve as placeholders for a dynamically generated value.

For Example:
Welcome, Joe
Welcome, [current-user:name]

Other Use Cases:
- System Generated Emails
- Path for Filefield Upload Files to be saved
- Pathauto
- Automatic Node Titles
- Etc.

Standardize API & Syntax
This can get out of control quick if everyone has their own system.
{user.name}
@@NAME@@
[user-name]vs[user:name]vs[user.name]


Standardized API & Syntax
Drupal 7 provides a standardized way to:

Announce tokens - hook_token_info()
Provide token values - hook_tokens()
Replace tokens in strings - token_replace()

Token Module
Contrib Module Provides UI and enhancements

[user:name], [node:author:name] (Chained Token)
[Token Type: Token]

Global Tokens
Can be calculated without additional context.

Contextual Tokens
Require additional data related to the current context in order to calculate a value.
