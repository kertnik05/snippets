Resources Tab

Make sure to be granular - for security reasons

Resouce 
CRUD Operations - Create, Rad, Update, Delete, and Index (List all nodes)
Relationships(depending on resource) - Files, Comments (Let's you access to the related content)
Targeted Actions - things that you can ask (CRUD, Actions) drupal on a particular resouce on drupal on behalf of the API
None of them have a permission of their own

For now: 
Node:  In CRUD, select Create, Retrieve, and Index

In Alias: It is for the url endpoint; instead of api/v1/node, you can have api/v1/content




api/v1/node/2.json - request the rest through browser, give me the node id 2 in json
api/v1/node.json - give me the all the node in json
- uri - it links to the main node
