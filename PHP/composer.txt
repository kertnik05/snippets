Installation:
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar

Creating the composer.json File by using composer.phar or you can manually edit composer.json
$ php composer.phar init
//note: you can install vendor package during init just by entering a vendor name: finder 
    //composer.json 
    {
        "name": "weaverryan/drupal",
        "require": {
            "symfony/finder": "v2.1.2"
        },
        "authors": [
            {
                "name": "Ryan Weaver",
                "email": "ryan@thatsquality.com"
            }
        ]
    }

If there's a composer.json generated from composer.phar init, then you can now run: $ php composer.phar install
    - install will create composer.lock - record what was installed at the time you ran the composer.phar install
    - you cannot run composer.phar install after the composer.lock is generated, you have to run:
         - composer.phar update or 
         - composer.phar update symfony/filesystem   //symfony/filesystem is the specific package you want to update


Ignore the vendor folder in git
# .gitignore
/vendor/
