1. List the cities in Morocco (just their names) in descending order by population.

Solution:
SELECT Name FROM City WHERE CountryCode = 'mar' ORDER BY Population DESC;

2. Now include the Population value to verify that the ordering was done correctly even when Population was not in the column list.

Solution:
SELECT Name, Population FROM City WHERE CountryCode = 'mar' ORDER BY Population DESC;
