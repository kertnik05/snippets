1. List the databases that contain the letter 'L' in their name.

Solution:
SHOW DATABASES LIKE '%L%';

2. List all of the collations that are the defaults for their character set.

Solution:
SHOW COLLATION WHERE `Default` = 'yes';

3. List all the numeric columns in the Country table.

Possible solution (will not retrieve DOUBLE, but WILL retrieve TEXT types):
SHOW COLUMNS FROM Country WHERE Type LIKE '%t(%';

Better solution:
SHOW COLUMNS FROM Country WHERE Type LIKE '%int(%' OR Type LIKE 'fl%' OR Type LIKE 'Dou%' OR Type LIKE 'Bit%';
