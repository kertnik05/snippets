What Search Engines See 
- Crawler 
    - screaming from - https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/ 
        - Check inlinks for broken links 
        - site:<sitename.com> inurl:<sitepath> 
            - If no results:
                Change the internal links on the site to directly point to /checkout/cart and the affiliate account login page (eliminating the need for a redirect)
                Instead of blocking /checkout/cart in the robots.txt file add the meta robots noindex tag instead to the page (We will cover noindex in the advanced section.)
                We could also noindex the affiliate account login page.
