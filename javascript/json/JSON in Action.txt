    "reknown":"Art College in New Dehli",
    "bio":"The Art College in New Dehli has sponsored Hassum on scholarship for his entire undergraduate career at the university, seeing great promise in his contemporary paintings of landscapes - that use equal parts muted and vibrant tones, and are almost a contradiction in art.

    "bio":"A first-year student at the Roux Academy of Art, Media, and Design, Riley is already changing the face of modern art at the university.
